# About Me

I'm an artist who doesn't believe that the different art forms should be placed in separate drawers. My research involves various forms of expression and apprehension and how to entangle them all poetically.
I use sensors, cameras, ordinary everyday objects, garbage, cables, radio modules, prototyping boards and computers running open source software.
In Berlin, I was a guest student from 2014 to 2017 at the course Generative Art / Computational Art in the UdK. I still collaborate with artists there, but I'm living in São Paulo, my hometown.
I have been been making visuals and music for performances, and performing myself alone and alongside with the collective Society for Non Trivial Pursuits, or S4NTP.

I don't believe that the different art forms should be put in separate drawers. My research involves various forms of expression and ways of entangle them to bring out new and open meanings. In my work I use sensors, cameras, common everyday objects, garbage, cables, radio modules, microcontrollers and computers with open source and free software.

Between 2014 and 2017, in Berlin / Germany, I was a guest student on the Generative Art / Computational Art course at UdK (University of the Arts). I collaborate with artists from there and elsewhere, from São Paulo. I produce images and music for solo and collaborative presentations, such as for the Society for Non-Trivial Pursuits (S4NTP) and the artist Ieltxu Ortueta.

From 1997 to 2011 I worked as webmaster, animator, and graphic designer in magazines, design studios, communication and advertising studios, such as MTV Brasil, Rico Lins Studio, Editora Três and Touché Propaganda.

## 2015

### DATA JAM // NANO PPGAV UFRJ >>> <<< RAUM 111 MEDIENHAUS UDK BERLIN //

Data coming from plants in Solar do Jambeiro, Niterói, Rio de Janeiro to the Room 111 in the UdK Medienhaus, in Berlin, used to generate music, and data going back to generate music there. In occasion of Hiper6. Event held from the NANO (Núcleo de Arte e Novos Organismos) from the UFRJ (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro).  
Were used SuperCollider, plants and Pure-Data, all communicating with each other through OSC.

### Live-drawing Performance FLOU! - Brazil

Soundtrack and sound-design, in collaboration with the artist Ieltxu Martinez Ortueta.  
The sounds translate the drawings from the spatial dimension. The sounds breathe, claim and express - algorithmically - the way with which the drawings are formed.
The music moves the body and the movement becomes drawing, or would it be the reverse? Drawing and paper have life of their own and express themselves through sound. To create is to give life to something that already exists?

### Performance Margem Abandonada - Berlin, Hildesheim

For the performance of the artist Mariana Senne.
A set of field recordings from São Paulo and Berlin that were used as material for soundscapes developed using SuperCollider, with which I searched for the intersection between our internal soundscapes and the everyday-life ordinary familiar sounds.
Presented at the Institute for Theater, Media and Popular Culture, University of Hildesheim.

### Moving Poets Festival – All That s Jazz, Novilla, Berlin

The Liebesbrunnen was presented in a short concert accompanied by a dancer in the Festival Moving Poets.
REPUBLIC 111 - network music with S4NTP.

### Music Makers Hacklab - A Score for Uncertainty, ICAS Festival, Dresden

Hosted by the Interspecifics collective and Alberto de Campo, Score for Uncertainty was a seven day long
collaborative laboratory focused on the creation of a sound composition from an unknown future using existing but novel instruments and sound catalogues. Participants collaborated in intensive mprovisational sessions aiming to analyse the way in which new devices could be involved in the creation of a futuristic soundscape. The result was presented as a live concert at the end of the ICAS Festival week in Dresden.

### Avanti Screening I - experimental short-films screening, at the Ehemaliges Stummfilmkino Delphi, Berlin

Creation and construction of the audiovisual instrument and interactive sculpture Liebesbrunnen. presented at the event as an interactive sculpture. Following is the description I made for it just before building it.  
> The installation will be a cylinder with a lot of small objects including working LEDs and Piezo Discs. There's a webcam at one side that captures what happens inside when someone moves it. The image is processed with Processing to make layers based on delays, and therefore adding the temporal dimension as a meaningful input.

### Geist Kino - Site-specific installation Zauberspiegel - Ehemaliges Stummfilmkino Delphi, Berlin

The event Geist Kino was presented in the program of the Vorspiel of the Transmediale Festival. The project has its origins in Brazil through the artist collective "Cine Fanstasma" and was accordingly, in the context of the upper seminar "Atlas of Mediendencies - Media Action in Berlin" by Prof. Dr. med. Siegfried Zielinski, adapted for Berlin.
Zauberspiegel is a site-specific installation with which one could see through time and between dimensions of everyday reality and the realities of old movies, particularly of the German expressionism. Through the mirror the face image of who is in front of Zauberspiegel merges with the face of an iconic character from the movies of yore. So it creates a communication channel that work in both directions.

## 2013

### Fanzine Reklamiertes Kapital - Zinefest Berlin

The artist Lina Tegtemeyer proposed the production of a version of an independent publication to be exhibited at Zinefest Berlin. My version of the Fanzine Reklamiertes Kapital had poetry, pictures, photographs and stencils, both that I did and some of the participants of a workshop I gave in São Paulo in 2011. The covers were made with exclusive and unique stencils for every copy.

## 2012

### Animation for the film Nós Outros (We Others). Collaboration with Estudio Anemona - Brasília / São Paulo

As an honorary member of the Estudio Anemona I created a series of short animations for the film Nós Outros (We Others), conceived and directed by Marina Weis. The illustrations are from Valentina Fraiz.  
> “We Others” departs from Brazil for a trip throughout Latin America. It’s a film-essay, a subjective collage, where, adding to the words and images collected during the journey, are excerpts from films and records of political facts: remembrances of a latent past that comes back, restless, to challenge the present. Coming together, geographies, generations and experiences weave themselves into ways of inhabiting space, the collective body, intimacy and, above all, our time.

## 2011

### Stencil Workshop for people living in shelters - Coorpel. São Paulo

The workshop was held at the cooperative for waste recycling, Coorpel. It intended to broaden the expression ability of the participants, to encourage their creativity, increase their confidence, self-esteem and the capacity of comprehension of the world that surrounds them. While providing pleasant moments of teamwork and learning.
The individualities could express themselves in favor of collective works by exchanging experiences and tasks. Thus the participants had the opportunity to learn from each other and notice that there are multiple paths and possibilities for expression or accomplishment of ideas.

## 1997-2011

I have worked since the late 1990s as a graphic designer, web-designer, webmaster, animator and art director, as a freelancer, and in design studios, magazines and agencies for communication, advertising and publicity. Among them are MTV Brasil, Rico Lins Studio, Editora Três and Touché Propaganda.
