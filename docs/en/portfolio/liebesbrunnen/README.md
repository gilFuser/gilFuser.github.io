# Liebesbrunnen

![image](/images/liebes/lb-000.png)

The Liebesbrunnen is a medium (or body, perhaps) that contains love. It is not meant to provide answers. It is one possible way to observe, experiment, play and connect with what happens inside us. It shows that love is not as beautiful, pure and clean, as one may think. Large and small movements can cause dramatic shifts inside. The Liebesbrunnen depends on observation, experimentation, gestures with human scale. In his momentum it creates sense and adds a new layer of meaning, proposing a question: how much love depends on interaction?

The Liebesbrunnen was originally created as an audio-visual installation in the beginnings of 2015 for the first edition of Avanti -experimental short films screening - held in the former silent film theatre, or Ehemaliges Stummfilmkino - Delphi, in Wedding, Berlin. In this edition Avanti’s theme was **The Conceptual Love**.
