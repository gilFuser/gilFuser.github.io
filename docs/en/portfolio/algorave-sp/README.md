Sao Paulo, March 17, 2018

On the occasion of the 6th anniversary of [Algorave](https://algorave.com/about/), AlgoSix was held in several cities around the world and also in SÃ£o Paulo. All was streamed and joined in a three-day event.

Shortly after arriving in Sao Paulo after a period of five years living in Berlin would happen the world event commemorating the six years of the Algorave movement. As there was no one willing to do it and I thought it was important and pertinent to mark our presence at the event, to strengthen the Brazilian live-coding scene, I decided to produce and promote the first Algorave on Brazilian soil. Even without financial support some line up was formed of excellent artists and I had the support of many others.
Many others will come.

> Algorave has no DJ and no playback, has code! The instruments are the laptops. The music is live coded. Improvised and / or composed while playing. The codes are designed for everyone to follow and sing along.

My great gratitude to the artists who participated:

LV - SuperCollider + SANDRO MICCOLI  
BEISE TidalCyles + SuperCollider  
 \+ SANDRO MICCOLI - Cyril  
SKMECS (A Society for Non Trivial Pursuits) - TidalCycles + SuperCollider  
 \+ CABELO (Bijari) - Resolume  
RICARDO CARIOBA - MPC + Microprocessador  
ALEXANDRE PORRES - Pure Data + SuperCollider  
LUIZA XAVIER - Streaming
