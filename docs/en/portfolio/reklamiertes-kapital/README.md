# Reklamiertes Kapital

In October 2013 the graphic artist and illustrator Lina Tegtemeier invited me to work with her in a fanzine (an independent publication). We worked along but with individual versions of it.  
I made my version with poetry, pictures, my own photographs and stencils, some made by myself and others from the participants of a workshop I gave in SÃ£o Paulo 2011. The covers were made with exclusive and unique stencils for every copy.
