# Caixa Automágica de Música Sensorial

On the occasion of Scratch Day at the Escola da Vila I proposed something different from [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) but related art and technology: a box-shaped instrument, played with light and shadow, movement, vibration and buttons.

> The box can be opened so you can see inside how it works and the inventor-artist can explain everything to anyone who wants to know about the sensors, electronic elements and codes that make the magic happen.
