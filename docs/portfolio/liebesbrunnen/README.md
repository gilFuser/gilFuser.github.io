# Liebesbrunnen

The Liebesbrunnen is a medium (or body, perhaps) that contains love. It is not meant to provide answers. It is one possible way to observe, experiment, play and connect with what happens inside us. It shows that love is not as beautiful, pure and clean, as one may think. Large and small movements can cause dramatic shifts inside. The Liebesbrunnen depends on observation, experimentation, gestures with human scale. In his momentum it creates sense and adds a new layer of meaning, proposing a question: how much love depends on interaction?
