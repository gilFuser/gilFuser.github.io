# Vital Territory

Performance in which four people are connected to heart rate and breathing sensors.  
The data extracted from the sensors are transformed into parameters of digital synths specially created for the performance with the use of the SuperCollider.  
Each person can hear sounds created and transformed by their own vital signs through a sound box positioned behind them as well as the sounds of others through each of the other speakers.

I start from the hypothesis that by providing biofeedback and neurofeedback of a group of people through sounds, their internal rhythms harmonize. As a harmony, I do not want to propose that they merge in a unison, but that the proportions between the individual sounds are balanced and from this equilibrium a harmonious sound emerges, in which the proportions are self-balanced and not chaotic.
